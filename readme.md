| **Factor**               | **Individual Farming**                                        | **SaveQuest Pooling**                                       |

| **Capital Efficiency**   | Small deposit = low yield, high relative gas fees             | Large pooled deposit maximizes yield & minimizes costs      |
| **User Experience**      | Complex: must pick farms, harvest manually, pay gas each time | Simple: one-click deposit, auto-harvest, no manual strategy |
| **Engagement**           | Boring — passive interest accrual                             | Fun — random monthly “winner,” gamified saving              |
| **Accessibility**        | Requires technical knowledge, risk assessment                 | Abstracted away — just join a pool                          |
| **Financial Discipline** | Easy to withdraw early                                        | Locked-in commitment helps enforce saving                   |
| **Transparency**         | Harder to verify yield distribution                           | Fully on-chain, verifiable selection & accounting           |
